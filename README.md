MSIS Project Front End is part of the MSIS (Medical Speciality Identification System) Project done in the course "Computing for Medicine" at IIIT Delhi.

About MSIS:-
This is a web application which identifies medical speciality on medical transcription data. This is an automation solution to replace the manual human intervention for booking appointment with a medical specialist. We will be using NLP techniques for processing the unstructured medical data and applying supervised machine learning to predict the medical specialty.
This application is currently capable to predict the follow medical specialities:
  Cardiovascular/Pulmonary
  General Medicine
  Surgery
  Radiology
  Orthopedic
  Consult - History and Physician

This MSIS application has a Flask backend, and it uses RestAPIs to get requests on the provided transcription.
The Link to the backend is:
https://github.com/ankit-mrexcalibur/MSIS-Project-Back-End

To install this application: "npm i"
This will install all the required node_modules.
To run: "npm start"

**Note: Use this with the backend turned on, with the same URL mentioned in the backend.**
